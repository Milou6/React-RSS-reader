# RSS reader (built with React⚛️ and Redux)

This RSS reader is a simple project built to practice my React skills. The interface is built with re-usable components, and the app uses the [rss2json API](https://rss2json.com/) under the hood to request RSS feeds. The user has no need to create his own API account, as the app uses **Netlify functions to securely hide API keys**✔ from the client-side.

The app also uses Local storage and Redux✨ to save User preferences, such as light/dark theme.
